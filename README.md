## 📂 Handling Large Files

Some files in this project (such as trained model artifacts and large datasets) exceed GitHub's standard file size limits. To work with these files:

### Files Tracked with Git LFS
- This repository uses [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for files up to 100 MB.
- To clone and use these files, install Git LFS:

```sh
# Windows (with Chocolatey)
choco install git-lfs
# Or download from https://git-lfs.github.com/
git lfs install
```

- After cloning the repository, run:
```sh
git lfs pull
```

### Files Exceeding GitHub's LFS Limit
- Some files (e.g., `ml/models/power_demand_rf_model.pkl`) are larger than 100 MB and cannot be stored on GitHub.
- Download these files from the following link(s):

**Model Artifact:** [Download power_demand_rf_model.pkl](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IORVHBWfgee0LLNgSqfh4BZOVakTRhit/view?usp=drive_link)
**Large Dataset:** [Download features_engineered.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wUdPtxOzCk6xmY8AYPMkPMPEXdxSlb4p/view?usp=drive_link)

Place the downloaded files in their respective folders:
- `ml/models/power_demand_rf_model.pkl`
- `data/processed/features_engineered.csv`

Update the paths if you change the folder structure.
